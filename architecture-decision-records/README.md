# Architecture Decision Records

## Overview

This directory contains a collection of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

ADR is a short document containing the records of architecturally significant decisions that affect the project, including its structure, functionalities, components, or work of the project teams. ADR provides, apart from decision itself, the context and consequences of implementing the discussed solution.

Find the template and guidelines for writing ADR documents [here](../guidelines/templates/resources/ADR.md).
