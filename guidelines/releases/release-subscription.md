# Subscribe to releases

Currently, GitHub does not offer an option to subscribe only to email notifications on new releases in repositories. The only GitHub-native option is to watch a given repository and receive notifications on all team discussions and updates that relate to it, including the release notifications.

To start watching a given repository, follow these steps:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. Expand the **Watch** drop-down menu in the upper-right corner and select **Watching**.

Alternatively, use free online tools, such as [CodeRelease.io](https://coderelease.io/), [GitPunch](https://gitpunch.com/), or [releases](https://releases.netlify.com/), to get e-mail notifications when the GitHub projects release a new version in the GitHub repositories that you watched and starred.
